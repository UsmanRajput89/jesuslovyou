                Good morning to everyone and welcome,
                <br>
                <br>
                My name is Madeleine-Daizy and I am the woman behind the jesuslovyou blog. I am French of Cameroonian origin. I was born and raised in France before falling in love with the city of London where I now live.
                <br>
                <br>
                I gave my life to Jesus in London in 2015. French is my mother tongue yet the gospel was brought to me in English. The Lord has his unique way of calling each of his children.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today I serve in the Anchor of Hope Christian Fellowship in London where I have been consecrated as a Young Minister of the Gospel. I also serve in intercessory prayer, Sunday school, and the young adult group.
                <br>
                <br>
                I created the jesuslovyou blog in September 2017 ( blog testimonial ) as the only bilingual Christian platform for the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. The goal of the blog is to strengthen Christians and non Christians by showing how knowledge of the Bible is applicable in our daily lives. The Bible says in Matthew 24:35 that everything will pass on Earth, only the word of God will not pass. Indeed, Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout my daily life, I apply the word of God, learn and then share my teaching with you. The blog is also a way to connect Christians with one another across the world, which is why it is bilingual in English and French.
                <br>
                <br>
                I would love to know a little more about my readers, so feel free to send me messages in French or English, to introduce yourself.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you have prayer requests, or want me to cover specific topics in my articles, please send them to me.
                <br>
                <br>
                Do not forget
                <br>
                <br>
