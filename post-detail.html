                        I finally felt exhausted, I decided to stay at home and stop going to church. At the end of 2018, I decided that I would not celebrate New Years. I found myself alone and I just sat down for hours, in the dark again. I wrote a long letter to God and I prayed one of the shortest prayers asking God for help and fell asleep. At the beginning of 2019, I started listening to Podcasts sermons to try and keep myself in God’s word, whilst out of a physical church. I emailed the pastor of the Podcast I was listening to and relayed where I was at. He responded that I would find a church in London, I was so annoyed because I had given up on attending church in person. I just wanted to sit in my sorrows, I was so tired. Still running around toiling in my endeavours. After the email, I started trying out churches with a friend and finally found a church near to me. I would intermittently attend, still fearing fully immersing myself in a flock. However, during 2020 when service moved online, I was able to attend consistently. I finally felt content in my head, but my Spirit kept kicking me like something wasn’t right.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Then the pastor announced that he would like to pray for those that feel they might deliverance. I had never taken deliverance seriously, I actually looked at it as theatrics, but again, my spirit kept kicking me. I couldn’t rest and I just kept looking at the circumstances of my life, it just didn’t feel normal. It didn’t sit in line with what I was reading in the word. Anyone that knows me well, knows that I hate asking for help, and I hate making a fuss. I like to blend into the background and just keep quiet. So, it was a big step for me to contact the pastor and actually attend the prayer session that had been organised. However, my spirit couldn’t rest. God got me to the church, and I attended for some prayer. I honestly don’t know what happened, I relayed some of the above and I remember the Pastor giving some words concerning fear. I knelt down for prayer and what took place subsequently, I cannot even articulate with words. All the pain, hurt and negative turmoil felt like it was being tugged out. For someone that has always tried to ensure that I am in control, this was an experience I could not have predicted.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        At the end of the prayer I was given some time to gather myself together and the scripture of promise came back to me. God gave this scripture to me when I was a younger and it would always come back to me when I felt like I couldn’t go on.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="basic-color blockquote">
                            ” For He Himself has said, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.” So we may boldly say: “The LORD is my helper; I will not fear.” Hebrews 13: 5-6
                        </span>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There is so much more I could share, but in summary, I would like to encourage anyone reading this testimony. God is your ever present help in times of need. You arrived on this earth because God had a plan for you, even before you were formed in your mother’s womb. No matter what you have seen or been through, God cares. He cares about every single fibre of your being. He knows your name and He loves you, unconditionally. You can only love God because He first loved you, unconditionally. He created the whole universe, so no matter where you are on this planet, He will find you, and He will never ever give up on you. Jesus loves you, and He defeated death so that you could have a life worth living. No matter what you have faced, God knows, and He cares, and He doesn’t just want you to survive, He wants you to thrive. He holds you in the palm of His hands, if you feel like you are falling or failing in life, call on Him. He will never ever leave or forsake you.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If life brings you to your knees look up to the hills and help will come. Call on the name of the Lord and He will save you. Even if all you can say is “help!”, trust me, God will send His ministering angels to help you. You are here because you matter, and you have a purpose and meaning in this very life. xxx
